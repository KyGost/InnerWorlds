# InnerWorlds
The code from my old project-- InnerWorlds.

This is a (progressive) web app for assisting in the management and organisation of DID/OSDD.

## Quality
No quality, at all, is guaranteed for this project; neither for code nor alike. Regrets, however, certainly are. (haha)

## Continuing the work
If you want to, feel free to make a fork.
Feel free, also, to then request a PR. If you make a considerable PR, I will likely give you permissions for this repo.
I am quite unlikely to merge anything myself.

## Licence
This project is licenced under AGPL-3. This means that you are free to use the code however you want as long as you don't charge for it and also licence whatever you use it for under AGPL-3.
